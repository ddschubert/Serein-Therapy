        <h2>Living with Marfan Syndrome</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Doré. I’m a therapist, an advocate, and someone who navigates the complexities of chronic illness and disability. I live with <strong>Marfan syndrome</strong>, a connective tissue disorder that touches nearly every part of my life—my spine, my eyes, my heart, and more. Connective tissue is like the glue holding your body together, and mine is fragile. That means my joints, spine, and organs don’t have the same support or stability as most people.</p>

<h2>Spine</h2>
<p>My spine has been a central part of my journey. Scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, brings pain, fatigue, and strain. In Marfan syndrome, the spine is less stable, so curves tend to be more severe and progress faster. I also have dural ectasia, where the lining that holds spinal fluid stretches outward, usually in the lower spine. For many, it’s asymptomatic—but not for me. It irritates nerves, disrupts spinal fluid pressure, and causes deep pain that worsens when I’m upright.</p>

<p>In my early 30s, the dural ectasia worsened and formed meningeoceles—pockets where the stretched lining pushes into weakened bone and presses on nerves. These form because the connective tissue meant to hold everything in place is too weak. Over time, spinal fluid pressure stretches the lining and slowly erodes the bone, creating space for these bulges.</p>

<p>I underwent extensive spinal fusion surgery to stabilize my spine and pelvis, protect my nerves, and reduce abnormal movement. Hardware supports weakened areas, eases pressure from dural ectasia and meningeoceles, and helps prevent further damage. Even now, I often need to lie down because standing or sitting increases spinal fluid pressure and pain. Some days the pain is overwhelming; other days, I feel almost like my old self again.</p>

<h2>Eyes</h2>
<p>My eyes have faced their own challenges. <strong>Retina detachments</strong>, which occur when the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye pulls away, are more common in Marfan syndrome because eye tissues are fragile. I’ve had detachments in both eyes, most recently as a complication from spinal surgery. On top of that, I have glaucoma, a condition where pressure inside the eye gradually damages the optic nerve. My left eye has required over 35 procedures, and vision loss is permanent, but I am grateful for my incredible team at Cloudbreak Eyecare in Calgary, who tirelessly work to protect what vision I have left.</p>

<h2>Heart</h2>
<p>And then there’s my heart. In Marfan syndrome, the connective tissue in the heart and blood vessels is weaker, which can cause the aorta to dilate over time, putting me at risk for <strong>serious complications if it isn’t monitored.</strong> I also have mitral valve prolapse, where the valve between the upper and lower chambers of the heart doesn’t close properly. In 2024, I had open-heart surgery—a valve-sparing aortic root replacement—to repair my aorta while keeping my valve. Since then, my heart has been stable, and I’m doing well.</p>

<p>Living with chronic illness has shaped the way I see therapy. I challenge traditional ideas of what therapy “should” look like. Many of my sessions happen while I’m lying down because my body needs it. That doesn’t make the work any less meaningful. Honoring the body’s needs allows for deeper focus, reflection, and healing. <strong>Comfort is part of the work.</strong> If you want to lie down, stay in pajamas, eat snacks, or simply be as comfortable as possible. . . I'm here for it.</p>

        <h2>Growing Up with a Brother with Disabilities</h2>
<p>Growing up with a brother who has a developmental disability gave me an early window into what it’s like to live in a world that often misunderstands people with differences. I saw how much patience, compassion, and support mattered, and I began my professional journey in direct care helping people with daily activities, personal care, and safety. I witnessed both the struggles and the triumphs of people whose voices are often overlooked. I realized that helping someone feel seen and understood can be just as important as helping them meet physical needs.</p>

        <h2>Finding My Purpose</h2>
<p>Over time, my focus shifted to therapy, where I could combine lived experience with professional skills to support people more holistically. Therapy, to me, is about creating space for people to be seen, heard, and supported regardless of background, ability, or challenge. It’s about helping people understand themselves, navigate their emotions, and live in a way that feels manageable and meaningful.</p>

       <h2>Walking With You</h2>
<p>Every person I work with teaches me something new. Every story I hear reinforces my belief that therapy should be accessible, compassionate, and inclusive. My life, both personal and professional, has been about turning experience into understanding and understanding into action.</p>
