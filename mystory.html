        <h2>Living with Marfan Syndrome</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Doré. I’m a therapist, an advocate, and someone who navigates the complexities of chronic illness and dynamic disability. I live with <strong>Marfan syndrome</strong>, a connective tissue disorder that affects my bones, eyes, heart, and other systems in ways that touch nearly every part of my life. Alongside this, I manage scoliosis and dural ectasia, both of which contribute to ongoing chronic pain. I often need to <strong>lay back to support my spine</strong>. Which is why I'm challenging the norm around traditional therapy and doing what is best for my body and laying back during sessions. I encourage you to do the same. If you want to lay down, be in your pj's, eat snacks, be the most COMFORTABLE you can possibly be - I'm here for it.</p>

        <h2>Growing Up with a Brother with Disabilities</h2>
        <p>Despite all these challenges, my life’s work has been shaped by my experiences and the people I care for. Growing up with a brother who has a developmental disability gave me an intimate understanding of what it feels like to live in a world that doesn’t always understand you. Watching him and my parents navigate systems, social expectations, and the daily grind of life, I realized how often people with disabilities are <strong>misunderstood, overlooked, or underestimated.</strong></p>

        <p> I started my professional journey in direct care, supporting individuals with developmental disabilities in their daily lives. This included personal care, feeding, administering medications, helping with activities, and ensuring safety and comfort. Through this work, I witnessed firsthand both the struggles and the triumphs of people whose voices are often ignored. I also realized how much impact <strong>compassion, patience, and genuine understanding can have.</strong></p>

        <h2>Finding My Purpose</h2>
        <p>Over time, my focus shifted to therapy, where I could combine my lived experience with professional skills to support people more holistically. While my early work was rooted in supporting those with developmental disabilities, <strong>my passion has grown to include everyone.</strong> Therapy, to me, is about creating space for people to be seen, heard, and supported no matter their background, abilities, or challenges. I want to help people understand themselves, navigate their emotions, and manage life in a way that feels manageable and meaningful.

        <h2>Walking With You</h2>
        <p>Every person I work with teaches me something new. Every story I hear reinforces my belief that therapy should be <strong>accessible, compassionate, and inclusive.</strong> My life experience thus far, both personal and professional, has been about turning experience into understanding, and understanding into action.</p>
